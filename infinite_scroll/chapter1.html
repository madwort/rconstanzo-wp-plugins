<p>At the center of this network/loop/web lies an integrated practice. My practice is centered around composing for <a href="http://www.rodrigoconstanzo.com/bio/" target="_blank">myself</a>, as an improviser, often using <a href="http://www.rodrigoconstanzo.com/instruments/" target="_blank">instruments</a>, both <a href="http://www.rodrigoconstanzo.com/software/" target="_blank">software</a> and <a href="http://www.rodrigoconstanzo.com/instruments/" target="_blank">hardware</a> based, that I have made myself. This is of particular significance as it informs my general approach to composition. In improvisation, composer and performer are one and the same. More to the point, composition and performance are also one and the same. Or as Steve Lacy responded to Frederic Rzewski’s request to describe, in fifteen seconds, the difference between composition and improvisation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In fifteen seconds the difference between composition and improvisation is that in composition you have all the time you want to decide what to say in fifteen seconds, while in improvisation you have fifteen seconds”. (Bailey 1993)</p>

<p>The scope of this integrated practice extends to the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a performer (of other people&#8217;s pieces (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFTBG1sae0M" target="_blank">O.P.P.</a>)) I trained as a classical pianist from an early age, later moving onto guitar (classical, rock, jazz), and finally playing primarily drums/percussion now. I played most of these instruments professionally for many years and still view music through the prism of instrumentality.</p>
<p>During a moment of enhanced lucidity I realized I no longer identified as a pianist, or a guitar even. The music I was making, and wanted to make, did not fit with these instruments of &#8220;lattice-based music&#8221; as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Wishart" target="_blank">Trevor Wishart</a> would put it in <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/On_Sonic_Art.html?id=h2J9v3hx_FgC" target="_blank">this book</a>. Even though I still identified myself as an instrumentalist, and saw the creation of music as having strong associations with performance, I felt the need pull away from the instruments with which I had developed a high level of facility.</p>
<p>This multi-instrumentality later found a home in a new music ensemble (<a href="http://distractfold.co.uk" target="_blank">Distractfold Ensemble</a>) in which I was a performer for the last three years. During my time in the group I performed on percussion, objects, guitar, voice, and electronics, going as far as winning the <a href="http://www.internationales-musikinstitut.de/en/news/newsarchive2014/1394-kranichstein-musikpreis-3.html" target="_blank">Kranichstein Music Prize</a> at the 47th <a href="http://www.internationales-musikinstitut.de/en/" target="_blank">Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt</a>. This chamber-centric performing allowed me to hone my general instrumental and musicianship skills, something that would come in handy in my own integrated practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instrumental virtuosity and the insights it brings in terms of abstract concepts, which can manifest as musical ideas, has profound legacy effects, even if you remove the physical dexterity which it is most commonly associated with, and recognized by. The facility that is developed throughout years of intense practice and a high volume of performances, is something that can be redirected. Any multi-instrumentalist will tell you that the second (and third) instrument comes quicker. Not only do you gain insights into your own learning process, thus becoming more efficient at internalizing ideas, but the majority of the knowledge is transferable after adapting the dexterity to a new instrument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>—————recycling and reapplication of virtuosity————&gt;</p>
<p>Instrumental dexterity and virtuosity takes on a completely different meaning when building and playing instruments that do not exist, and have little to no context/canon to draw on. This is a complicated issue when dealing with instruments that are somewhat similar to existing instruments (see Specty, Electric Whisks) and are somewhat complex in their interaction, but becomes even more complicated when dealing with simpler instruments, or designing software and systematic interaction. How does one become a virtuoso of an instrument made out of only two knobs? We all have the physical dexterity and attributes required to engage with these instrument at a high level. What then makes one a virtuoso? And more importantly, where does that virtuosity reside?</p>
<p>Developing an instrumental dexterity has not only informed how I compose and perform music, but how I approach building software/hardware instruments. The physical and mental acuity is of particular importance in the context of improvisation.</p>
<p>—————importance of improvisation————&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>“In the best of all possible worlds, art would be unnecessary. Its offer of restorative, placative therapy would go begging a patient. … The audience would be the artist and their life would be art.“ &#8211; Glenn <span class="il">Gould &#8211; </span></em><span class="citationCollectionTitle">Glenn Gould Reader</span>, <span class="citationSubTitle">“Music and Technology”</span>, p. 353</p>
<p>—————composition and hierarchy————&gt;</p>
<p>The traditional model of composer to performer is that of top-down communication, where the composer—traditionally the originator of ideas—is required to symbolically reinterpret those ideas (via notation and language) to yield a sonic output, utilizing the performer as his medium. (Nattiez 1990) Historically, this has been done via symbols scribed on paper, and in some cases supplemented with the guidance of the composer, should he still be alive to give performers audible verbal direction. The music this process yields is almost completely dependent on the precision of the translations and reinterpretations of those symbols.</p>
<p>When the distinction between composer and performer is collapsed, the medium of communication (notation/interpretation) is no longer audible. There is nothing to translate to yourself. No “interpretation” to deal with. The addition of improviser places the creator (composer/performer/improvisor) at multiple points in the creative process, in the conceptual inception and formal rigor applied as a composer to the articulation of intentions of the performer and finally to the aesthetic recontextualization of the composers decisions as an improviser. When this streamlining extends to the instruments themselves and you have a composer/performer playing on their own instrument, the language becomes more personal. There is no canon to draw on for notation or instrumental techniques. What is created bears the mark of the composer/performer/luthier.</p>
<p>Having spent most of my life developing the mental and physical ability to play whatever I want in realtime, it proved counterintuitive to come up with ideas, write them down to then later read and perform them. Each step of that process introduces aesthetic debris due to the prioritization of content as the ideas are translated from medium to medium. This is especially the case in terms of pitch/rhythm dominance in traditional notation (Wishart 1997).</p>
<p>Notation has taken an ever decreasing role in my music. As much as I like the look of a beautiful or clever score, the manner in which is presented doesn’t mean anything and the score itself often exists as a fetish object disconnected from it’s informative functionality. It also occupies very little of my compositional time and concerns, sharing with Partch’s view that</p>
<p>“[N]otation is the least of a music’s ingredients, one that might be supplied on little more than a moment’s notice. To provide a notation is a matter of paper and pencil and a good night’s sleep; but to evolve a theory, to develop instruments based upon it, and to write and present music conceived therefrom is easily the matter of a lifetime” (Partch 1974)</p>
<p>Much of my technological research (see section 2.3) is finding a more practical and pragmatic way to communicate information that is not burdened with the historical weight of legacy notation.</p>
<p>—————diy background/context————&gt;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My interest in DIY instruments stems from electronic tinkering when I was younger. I began by trying to make my own guitar pedals, then moved onto Circuit-Bending, and later hardware synth making. Sound was something that I literally made with my hands and instruments were not “black boxes” that were simply played. This inclusion of the creation of instruments as part of the creative process is something that is still part of my work today.</span></p>
<p>—————interest in chaotic/random processes————&gt;</p>
<p>There is an element of aleatory involved in some of the DIY instruments I make. Circuit- bending, in particular, is effective for creating unpredictable tones and random musical fragments which “can be truly fascinating as generated by the out-of-theory electronic instrument”. (Ghazala 2006) This incorporation of chance elements, through electronic intervention, into a composed/improvised context is both very powerful and challenging. Sometimes this unpredictable element of instrument design happens in the assembly and tuning of circuits, like in the instruments of Peter Blasser where the choice of timing capacitors informs the clock frequencies in different parts of the circuit. Blasser’s design aesthetic for schematic vs manifestation mirrors my approach to notation vs performance (see section 2.4.1) where “Unlike a schematic, in which electronic ideas are transcribed only symbolically, a paper circuit design suggests a physical placement as well; it is immanent in that the design becomes the manifestation.” (Blasser 2007)</p>

<p>—————move towards digital————&gt;</p>
<p>Although the large part of my DIY instruments are hardware-based I do not share Richards “digital allergy” where the creation of new instruments is part of an effort to “dislodge the ubiquity of digital technology” viewing analog, or “dirty” electronics in opposition to “the sterile world of mass-produced digital technology”. (Richards 2008) I draw no distinction between analog and digital instruments insofar as my desire to make and work with them. Technology is simply a tool that one can use to articulate their creative ideas.</p>
<p>—————aesthetic ownership————&gt;</p>
<p>One of my main interests in making my own hardware instruments is that I can create not only unique sounds and playing methods, but each instrument can imply it’s own language and syntax. Unlike the Baschet brothers who created visually stunning and novel instruments only to model them on existing instruments, my main interest was using these DIY instruments to craft a new music. (Baschet 1999) I share Hopkin’s view that “most musical instruments are not intended to explore those possibilities anew; they are modeled after preexisting types”. (Hopkin 2006) My approach with hardware instruments is closer to Harry Partch in that he created his own instruments as a means to an end, with the end being his own personal music. (Partch 1974)</p>
<p>—————aesthetic domain (meta-awareness)————&gt;</p>
<p>INCORPORATE META-CREATIVE LOOP (form, memory, instrumentation, etc&#8230;)</p>
<p>As composers we can choose our aesthetic domain, much like we can choose the instrumentation we work with, or the large-scale formal models of our compositions. The aesthetic window is the scope of our practical creativity. Our ability to think divergently is what defines the size of this window. We do not have immediate control over the aperture of this window, but can expand our ability to think creatively. This ability to think divergently is central to the idea of creativity. (Guilford 1950)</p>
<p>For historical reasons, serious music is often something that is presented to a seated audience, in a quiet space, after money has exchanged hands, either directly or through subsidy. Or as eloquently put by Harry Partch</p>
<p>“Couple these shortcomings of ‘serious’ music with the austerity of the concert hall —rampant formality, huge impersonal assemblies with closely placed, hard, stiff- backed seats, black and white ‘tails,’ brisk robots on stage” (Partch 1974)</p>
<p>Granted, he speaks of a more formal time in terms of apparel, but the general severity and tone is still present.</p>
<p>I avoid attending or having my music performed at these kinds of concerts. I prefer the informal context of the “gig” where a variety of music is performed, generally by the people who composed it. I view the manner that a composer presents his music to the world as part of the creative act. The compositions I have produced this year can technically be performed in front of any audience but the ‘adequate’ mode of listening, to borrow a term from Stockfeld, is in this informal context. (Schwarz 1997) I am addressing this exact concern in some upcoming compositions by breaking down what the role of performer and audience is.</p>

<h1>The Now (or &#8220;Improvisation&#8221;)<a name="thenow"></a></h1>
<p>—————writing for improvisers a lot</p>
<p>All of the material submitted here contains improvisation in some form or another. Improvisation itself is, in this way, central to my practice. This extends beyond</p>
<p>—————difficulty/complexity (include wolff)————&gt;</p>
<p>ADD BOOTCAMP INFO?</p>
<p>Having an interest in improvisation and composition, I have written many compositions specifically for improvisers in the past. I find this to be a very unique and interesting challenge as much of what one does as a composer is to make specific and detailed decisions. My main interest in composing for improvisers is to produce situations, challenges, and methods of interaction that are difficult to do spontaneously within an improvisation, which manifest themselves in an audible excitement and tension in the music. This approach has similar ends to the work of composers like Ferneyhough and Barrett, but the tension and complexity is achieved not through notational specificity.</p>
<p>—————contextualize practice (zorn, braxton, wolff, cage, stockhausen)————&gt;</p>
<p>One of the most effective compositions for improvisers I have come across is the game piece Cobra by John Zorn. The composition consists of a series of systems which can be called into effect by any performer at any time with a single conductor acting as the information conduit, holding up cue cards with symbols representing each system. What I find most exciting about the composition, as a composer, performer and conductor7 , is that Zorn is not the primary decision maker. The content of each system is a type of interaction or behavior, which the performers adhere to. The specific content of that is completely up to the discretion of the performers.</p>
<p>—————intuition, immediacy, transcience————&gt;</p>
<p>I place my aesthetic trust in the hands, or more precisely the ears, of improvisers. Therefore I view the role of composition in the</p>
<p>Listening, context, and the ability to make decisions are of prime importance in improvised music. (Stevens 1985)</p>
<p>I believe in the power of intuition in improvisation in that I believe when you are completely fluid and comfortable with your improvisation, you can play things beyond your knowledge, and sometimes ability. Stockhausen calls this being a “radio receiver” where</p>
<p>“you are no longer satisfied with expressing yourself, you are not interested in yourself at all…. Then you will be amazed at what happens o you, when this state is acheived; when you become aware of what happens through you, even for short moments, you will be quite astonished. You become a medium”. (Stockhausen 1989)</p>
<p>This is in opposition to Cage’s view that “improvisation is something that I want to avoid. Most people who improvise slip back into their likes and dislikes, and their memory, and they don’t arrive at any revelation that they’re unaware of”. (Turner 1992)</p>
<p>—————political subtext————&gt;</p>
<p>When working with larger groups of improvisers, there is a democracy to how the music unfolds. There is a political subtext to the collapsing of the composer/performer hierarchy in improvisation which I find in line with my philosophical and political views (see section 2.4). That subtext is not accidental. That is not to say that relationships do not develop, such as foreground/background, which come with an implicit hierarchy, but the negotiation of that space is done democratically.</p>
<p>Up to this point, most of my composition for improvisers has been ‘flat’, in that I compose a world for the piece to live in, be it a type of interaction, trajectory, game etc… and then the piece primarily lives in that world, as articulated by the improvisers. I do plan on exploring what Braxton calls “co-ordinate music structural dynamics”, where at any point “somebody could be playing structural models, notated models, language models, extended improvisation, unified structures, cross-structures, opposition structures.” (Lock 1989) Fundamentally, this means a shift in writing from one or two people, to writing for three or more people, something that the dfscore system will facilitate.</p>

<p>Technology, and specifically how it relates to aesthetics, is a big part of what I spend my time and energy on. A common thread through nearly all of the projects presented here is their use of technology, be it through DIY instruments, modified electronics, or software systems. These technological developments are intertwined with the work they produce.</p>
